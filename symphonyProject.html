    <h2>SYMPHONY GRAPHIC DESIGN RROJECT</h2>
    <p>The project prompt tasked us with selecting a specific aesthetic and using it as the foundation to design a layout for a tabloid-sized paper. On one side, we were to create an eye-catching poster that visually represented the chosen aesthetic, while on the opposite side, we were to develop an informational schedule for the Colorado Symphony Orchestra. A key challenge of the project was that we were required to incorporate all provided information without excluding any details. The final design had to be both functional and visually appealing, ensuring it could be folded into eighths for easy mailing. This project called for a balance between artistic expression and practicality, as we created a compact yet comprehensive promotional piece that could be sent through the mail.</p>
    <p>The key design decisions Iâ€™d like to highlight are the orientation and distribution of each showing. I opted for a four-by-four grid of columns and rows, leaving one fourth of the space dedicated to the mailing address and a cohesive design element. While this layout posed a challenge in fitting all the information, it ultimately ensures that when folded, there are no creases over the content, preserving legibility. </p>
