    <h2>JEWLERY BOX DESIGN PROJECT</h2>
    <p>The project prompt asked us to select a project that would enhance our quality of life. I chose to design a custom jewelry box tailored to fit perfectly in the drawer of my desk, addressing a very real challenge—my apartment's limited space. This project not only solved an organizational issue but also provided a practical, space-saving solution that helped maximize functionality in my small living space</p>
    <p>There were several key specifications that I had to consider when designing the jewelry box. The first constraint was the limited dimensions of the drawer, which turned out to be much shallower than I had originally anticipated and, to add to the challenge, it didn’t fully extend. Additionally, I needed to factor in the length of my necklaces and the optimal spacing between each slot to ensure that they would be stored efficiently and remain tangle-free. These considerations were crucial in creating a design that was both functional and space-conscious.</p>
