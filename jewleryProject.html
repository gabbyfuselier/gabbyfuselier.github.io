    <h2>JEWLERY BOX DESIGN PROJECT</h2>
    <p>The prompt that we were given was to choose a project that would help improve your livelihood. The project that I chose was a custom Jewlery box to fit in the drawer of my desk due to a very unfortunate lack of space in my apartment.</p>
    <p>There were a couple specifications that I had to take into account. First constraint was the dimensions of said drawer, which happened to be much shallower than anticipated as well as it not being able to pull all the way out.</p>
