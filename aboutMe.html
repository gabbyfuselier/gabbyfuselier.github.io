          <p>I grew up in the heart of Silicon Valley, surrounded by innovation and technology. This environment naturally sparked my interest in problem-solving and creativity, shaping my approach to both my personal and professional life. I've always found comfort in the logical nature of math, appreciating the certainty of having a correct answer, while also balancing this with a passion for art, where expression and imagination are key. I love being given constraints because they challenge me to explore boundaries and find innovative solutions within them. </p>
  
          <p>Growing up, I was active in sports, playing soccer and volleyball, which instilled in me a strong sense of teamwork and discipline. In addition to sports, I enjoy staying fit and making time for the gym to stay healthy and challenge myself physically. When I need a break from structured activities, I love spending time outdoors, whether it's hiking through nature or skiing down a mountain.</p>
  
          <p>Traveling is another passion of mine, and I've had the opportunity to explore many parts of the world. My travels have taken me to countries like Germany, Austria, England, France, Switzerland, Costa Rica, and the Netherlands, broadening my perspectives and fueling my curiosity. Through all these experiences, I've developed a love for learning and discovering new things, whether through the pages of a book or the adventures of travel.</p>
  
          <p>I'm driven by a love for innovation and creativity, and I believe in the power of combining logic with artistic expression to solve problems. As I move forward in my career, I aim to continue exploring these passions, applying them to meaningful work that blends technical skill with creative solutions.</p>
