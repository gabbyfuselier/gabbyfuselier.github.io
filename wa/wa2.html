    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> Hi, my name is Gabby Fuselier. I use she/her pronouns. I used to play Volleyball and Soccer but stopped when I went into college. I enjoy math and art and creating new things. My favorite color is green and my favorite animals is probably an otter. My goals for this course are to learn how to create my own website and also hopefully learn how code can translate into real world things.   </p>
