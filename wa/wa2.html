    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> Hi, my name is Gabby Fuselier. I use she/her pronouns. I used to play volleyball and soccer but stopped when I went into college. I enjoy math and art and creating new things. My favorite color is green and my favorite animal is probably an otter. I don't watch youtube so this link is not necessarily my "favorite" video but something I found within the time doing this assignment and thought was funny. My goals for this course are to learn how to create my own website and also hopefully learn how code can translate into real world things.   </p>
