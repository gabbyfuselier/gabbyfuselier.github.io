    <h2>LAUNDRY ALARM MECHANICAL PROJECT</h2>
    <p>The prompt that we were given was to solve a personal pet peeve that would also encourage user interaction. The pet peeve that I chose was when my roommates leave their clothes in the dryer. The solution that I came up with was an alarm that would only turn off when the laundry door was opened.</p>
    <p>I did this by using a hall effect sensor to see if the door was closed, a piezo motion sensor to test if the laundry was on, and a MIDI mp3 speaker to play the alarm. There are delays included when the machine is deciding whether or not the laundry is on to prevent confusion if the laundry ever gets accidentally knocked. There are also delays when the machine is deciding if the laundry is off to prevent confusions about pauses during the cycle.</p>
