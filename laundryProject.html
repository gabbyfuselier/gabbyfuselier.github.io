    <h2>LAUNDRY ALARM MECHANICAL PROJECT</h2>
    <p>The project prompt challenged us to address a personal pet peeve while encouraging user interaction. For my solution, I chose to tackle the frustration of my roommates leaving their clothes in the dryer. To solve this, I designed an innovative alarm system that would only stop sounding once the laundry room door was opened, ensuring that the clothes were promptly removed and helping to maintain a more organized, considerate shared space.</p>
    <p>I implemented this solution using a hall effect sensor to detect whether the door was closed, a piezo motion sensor to determine if the laundry was running, and a MIDI MP3 speaker to play the alarm. To prevent false triggers, I incorporated delays that allow the system to accurately determine whether the laundry is on or off, ensuring it won't be confused by accidental disruptions, such as the laundry being knocked or brief pauses in the cycle.</p>

    <h2>NOTES</h2>
    <ul class = "feedback">
        <li>Implement a solution to eliminate speaker rattling, ensuring the sound quality remains clear and free from unwanted vibrations.</li>
        <li>Strengthen the enclosure to ensure a secure, durable design, preventing any part, such as the top, from coming loose during use.</li>
        <li>Solder all connections thoroughly to guarantee that no wires become disconnected, ensuring the system remains reliable and functional over time.</li>
        <li>Refine the overall appearance to make the device look as polished and professional as possible, creating a finished product that feels complete and ready for use.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>FINAL DESIGN</h2>
    <p>In progress</p>
